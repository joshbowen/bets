Ben Leventhal predicts that there will be a 100 game suspension for Shohei Ohtani for his (alleged) involvement in betting with his interpreter, Ippei Mizuhara.


Josh says that there will be less than 100 game suspension, if any.


The bet is $500 - if 100 or more, Ben wins. If 99 or less, Josh wins.


The bet discussion was initiated at Lizzie’s PDT BD dinner.
